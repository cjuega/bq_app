# DropboxLibrary #

Android app that connects to Dropbox accounts and use them as book libraries.

Currently there are two folders available:

* app: which contains the app itself.

* test: which contains an Android test project to check the app's correctness.


## External tools ##

This approach uses two external libraries:

* The [dropbox sync API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/sync) to connect to Dropbox accounts and manage dropbox files.

* The [epublib](http://www.siegmann.nl/epublib/android) library to read .epub files.
